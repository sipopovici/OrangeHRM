To add a system user, go to Admin>>   User Management>> Users and click “Add”, a screen as shown in
Figure 1.2 would appear. 

Click “Save” once the fields are added. 

*Note: An employee list needs to be created first under the PIM Module to create user logins. Alternatively, a
user login could be created when adding employees under the PIM Module (refer to Chapter 6.3.) 

To create a user login the following needs to be entered: 

●  User Role: You can assign user roles for each user whether they would fall under as an “Admin” or
“ESS” user type to define their user rights. 

●  Admin: have access full access to the system.  
●  ESS: limited access to the system. It could be an ESS-Supervisor or ESS-Employee. 

# ESS-Supervisor:  where the user has access to his/her particulars and his/her
subordinates’ particulars. 
# ESS-Employee: where the user has access only to his/her particulars. 

●  Employee Name   
*If an HR Admin is an existing employee, he/she needs to be defined in the PIM Module
●  Username
●  Status – Enabled or disabled
●  Password
●  Confirm Password (Re-enter the password) 

A list of user logins as shown in Figure 1.3 would appear once an entry is added. You may also add multiple
entries of user logins. The default system user available will be Admin and has full access to the system. 

*Note: System User Logins need to be communicated manually to employees. 

To delete a system user, click on the check box next to the “Username”. It is also possible to delete multiple
entries at the same time by clicking the check box entries you wish to delete and simply clicking “Delete”. ",,robadi9664,637ea40d3e79f12e5720faef,,,,,,,,,,OH-76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,OH-1,Admin Module,,,,,0|i00007:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To Do
