Alternatively, a  <br>user login could be created when adding employees under the PIM Module (refer to Chapter 6.3.)  <br>  <br>To create a user login the following needs to be entered:  <br>  <br>● User Role: You can assign user roles for each user whether they would fall under as an “Admin” or  <br>“ESS” user type to define their user rights.  <br>  <br>● Admin: have access full access to the system.  <br>● ESS: limited access to the system. It could be an ESS-Supervisor or ESS-Employee.  <br>  <br>\# ESS-Supervisor: where the user has access to his/her particulars and his/her  <br>subordinates’ particulars.  <br>\# ESS-Employee: where the user has access only to his/her particulars.  <br>  <br>● Employee Name  <br>*If an HR Admin is an existing employee, he/she needs to be defined in the PIM Module  <br>● Username  <br>● Status – Enabled or disabled  <br>● Password  <br>● Confirm Password (Re-enter the password)  <br>  <br>A list of user logins as shown in Figure 1.3 would appear once an entry is added. You may also add multiple  <br>entries of user logins. The default system user available will be Admin and has full access to the system.  <br>  <br>*Note: System User Logins need to be communicated manually to employees.  <br>  <br>To delete a system user, click on the check box next to the “Username”. It is also possible to delete multiple  <br>entries at the same time by clicking the check box entries you wish to delete and simply clicking “Delete”. |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | 19/Jan/23 3:13 PM | To Do |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | Admin Module for OrangeHRM |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | 0\|i00007: |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
